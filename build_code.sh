# Code compilation script for Query Point Manager.
# 
# This script should contain all application code compilation steps.
# For interpreted languages (Python, JavaScript, etc.), this can remain empty.
# For compiled languages, move compilation commands here from your Dockerfile.
#
# Examples:
# - Go: go build -o app .
# - Java: javac *.java  
# - C/C++: gcc main.c -o app
# - Rust: cargo build --release
#
# Exit with non-zero status if compilation fails.

# Add your compilation commands here
